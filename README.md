# Evaluate-The-Kell

Wrote the evaluateor for a new language Called Kell which follows the same paradigms as Haskell but has a little more features on top. Used Haskell as the base language to write the type inference and completely tested the code using Property based testing and observed that the language is able to Evaluate any given expressions in its syntax.
